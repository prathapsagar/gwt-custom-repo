testNG 5.14.1 (through at least 5.14.10) happens to include junit 3.8.1 inside
its jar.  Since we now run with junit4, even though we aren't yet using
the annotation-based junit4-isms, we removed those from the jars here using
the strip_junit.sh script here.

The sources jar does not have junit embedded, and did not need processing.
