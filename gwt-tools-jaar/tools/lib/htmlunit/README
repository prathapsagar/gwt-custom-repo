The custom jars hold the HtmlUnit jars while we upgrade to HtmlUnit-2.8 and
beyond, and revisit all the Gwt tests that are currently ignored on HtmlUnit.
The htmlunit jar names are to be removed of all identifying information because
we don't want multiple copies. 

For updating HtmlUnit, here is the algorithm to use (vetted by HtmlUnit
committers): 

* Check the main Cl page (http://build.canoo.com/htmlunit/). Find the last
build that was successful. Find the svn revision (click on the "XML Log File"
tab, and scroll down to the last "revision" XML tag. search for <revision>).
Download the htmlunit.jar, htmlunit-sources.jar and htmlunit-core-js.jar (and
other dependencies if they have changed) from the artifacts page. Note that
SNAPSHOT artifacts only get generated if all unit tests pass. So the artifacts
correspond to the last successful build. 

* Download the htmlunit-core-js-sources.jar from 
http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/m2-repo-snapshots/net/sourceforge/htmlunit/htmlunit-core-js/2.8-SNAPSHOT/  
(verify that the core-js.jar are the same as in the previous step). 

* Create a directory with htmlunit-r<revision> or htmlunit-2.8 for the 2.8
release. In the directory, place files:
 htmlunit-r<revision>.jar
 htmlunit-r<revision>-sources.jar
 htmlunit-core-js-r<revision>.jar
 htmlunit-core-js-r<revision>-sources.jar

* Update the following files with the new file names:
 dev/build.xml
 eclipse/dev/.classpath
 eclipse/user/.classpath

Previously, for 2.5 and r5070, the htmlunit files were placed in the main
directory and no separate directory was created. Doing so, however, causes too many
files in the main directory. Since there cannot be any updates or deletions to
the tools stuff files, those files are left as-is.

The current svn revision: 5940
